## Combine Colours

### Analogous Colours

- Take one color on the color wheel and combine it with the color that's immediately next to it
- Incredibly harmonious and easy to look at
- Use when design app main interface or background screen
- Should choose the color that make users feel pleasant, so that they will stay within the app for the long time
- Analogous Colours in **Colours wheel**

### Complementary Colours

- Match one color with the color that directly opposites to it
- Produce extremely classy design
- Can be good for logo design or attention grabbing
- But they don't make a new look for your app interface

### Split Colours

- Instead choosing directly opposite colours, you can split that color into its analogous colors (2 next to colors)
- You end up with still attention grabbing but less classy and easy to look at
- Use for designing logo

### Triadic Colours

- Choose three colors those make a triagle in color wheel
- It has well balanced but still attention grabbing
- But it pretty much was used in 90s (traditional print design and advertising design)

### Monochromatic

- Taking the same color and combining it with either various amounts of white or various amounts of black to create different tones and shades that stand out from each other
