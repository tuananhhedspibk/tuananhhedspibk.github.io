## Combine Colours

### Analogous Colours

- Take one color on the color wheel and combine it with the color that's immediately next to it
- Incredibly harmonious and easy to look at
- Use when design app main interface or background screen
- Should choose the color that make users feel pleasant, so that they will stay within the app for the long time
- Analogous Colours in **Colours wheel**

### Complementary Colours

- Match one color with the color that directly opposites to it
- Produce extremely classy design
- Can be good for logo design or attention grabbing
- But they don't make a new look for your app interface

### Split Colours

- Instead choosing directly opposite colours, you can split that color into its analogous colors (2 next to colors)
- You end up with still attention grabbing but less classy and easy to look at
- Use for designing logo

### Triadic Colours

- Choose three colors those make a triagle in color wheel
- It has well balanced but still attention grabbing
- But it pretty much was used in 90s (traditional print design and advertising design)

### Monochromatic

- Taking the same color and combining it with either various amounts of white or various amounts of black to create different tones and shades that stand out from each other

## Typography

### Serif

There are some **feets** so you can feel older when use this type of Typography
Look more traditional. Usually use for
- Law
- Modern brand

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43769314/62988516-ad5a2180-be7f-11e9-8fd0-15b0298eb8af.png" width="720">

Serif is splited into **4 major families**
- **Old Style**
- **Transitional** - Time new romans
- **Modern**
- **Slab-Serif**

How to differentiate three of them (Old style, Transitional, Modern)
- Look at the thinnest versus thickest part of the letters -> We call that is **modulation of the typeface**
- **Old style** is written by **flat nipped pens**

**Slab-Serif** - zero different between thickest and thinnest parts of the font - used for newpapers printing

### Sans serif

**Geometric** is the most modern type

Compare between **Human type face** and **Grotesque**

**Humans type face** has more open shapes

There's less distance between each of the letters than **human type face**

Less confusion between **g** and **9** on **human type face**

=> **Huamn type face** is more readability than **Grotestque**

### Combine fonts

Serif and San serif work together very well

Heading uses **Serif**, Body uses **San-serif** (sanserif is more readability than serif)

Do not combine:
- **serif** with **serif**
- **san-serif** with **san-serif**

It will be **bland** and **undifferentiated**

Two different fonts is really good, no more
