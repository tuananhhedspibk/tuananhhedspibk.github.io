## Past continous

### A. Example

Yesterday, Karen and Jim played tennis. At 10.30, they **were playing** tennis

They **were playing** = they were in the middle of playing. They had not finished playing

> I/he/she/it + was + V-ing
> We/you/they + were + V-ing

### B. I was doing something = I was in the middle of doing something at a certain time. The action or situation had already started before this time, but had not finished

- This time last year I **was living** in Brazil.
- I waved to Helen, but she **wasn't looking**.

### C. Compare the past continous and past simple

*Past continous* (in the middle of an action)
- I **was walking** home when I met Dan
- Kate **was watching** TV when we arrived

*Past simple* (complete action)
- I **walked** home after the party last night.
- Kate **watched** TV a lot when she was ill last year.

### D. We often use the past simple and the past continous together to say that something happened in the middle of something else:
- Matt **phoned** while we **were having** dinner
- It **was raining** when I **got** up
- I **hurt** my back when I **was working** in the garden

But we use the past simple to say that one thing happended after another
- I **was walking** along the road when I **saw** Dan. So I **stopped** and we **had** a chat

Compare:
- When Karen arrived, we **were having** dinner. (= we had already started before she arrived)

- When Karen arrived, we **had** dinner (= Karen arrived, and then we had dinner)

### E. Some verb (for example know and want) are not normally used in the coninous
- We were good friends. We **knew** each other well.


## Present perfect 1

### A. Example

- Tom is looking for his key. He can't find it. He **has lost** his key

> have / has + P(II)

### B. When we say that 'something has happened', this is usually new information

- Ow! I **'ve cut** my finger.
- The road is closed. There **'s been** an accident.

When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with *now*. The action in the past has a result *now*:

- Where's your key? I don't know. I **'ve lost** it (= I don't have it *now*)
- He told me his name, but I **'ve forgotten** it (= I can't remember it *now*)
