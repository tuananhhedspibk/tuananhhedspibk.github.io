#### B. I was doing something = I was in the middle of doing something at a certain time. The action or situation had already started before this time, but had not finished

- This time last year I **was living** in Brazil.
- I waved to Helen, but she **wasn't looking**.

*Past continous* (in the middle of an action)
- I **was walking** home when I met Dan
- Kate **was watching** TV when we arrived

*Past simple* (complete action)
- I **walked** home after the party last night.
- Kate **watched** TV a lot when she was ill last year.
