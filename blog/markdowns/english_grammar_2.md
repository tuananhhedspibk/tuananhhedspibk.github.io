## Past continous

### A. Example

Yesterday, Karen and Jim played tennis. At 10.30, they **were playing** tennis

They **were playing** = they were in the middle of playing. They had not finished playing

> I/he/she/it + was + V-ing
> We/you/they + were + V-ing

### B. I was doing something = I was in the middle of doing something at a certain time. The action or situation had already started before this time, but had not finished

- This time last year I **was living** in Brazil.
- I waved to Helen, but she **wasn't looking**.

### C. Compare the past continous and past simple

*Past continous* (in the middle of an action)
- I **was walking** home when I met Dan
- Kate **was watching** TV when we arrived

*Past simple* (complete action)
- I **walked** home after the party last night.
- Kate **watched** TV a lot when she was ill last year.

### D. We often use the past simple and the past continous together to say that something happened in the middle of something else:
- Matt **phoned** while we **were having** dinner
- It **was raining** when I **got** up
- I **hurt** my back when I **was working** in the garden

But we use the past simple to say that one thing happended after another
- I **was walking** along the road when I **saw** Dan. So I **stopped** and we **had** a chat

Compare:
- When Karen arrived, we **were having** dinner. (= we had already started before she arrived)

- When Karen arrived, we **had** dinner (= Karen arrived, and then we had dinner)

### E. Some verb (for example know and want) are not normally used in the coninous
- We were good friends. We **knew** each other well.


## Present perfect 1

### A. Example

- Tom is looking for his key. He can't find it. He **has lost** his key

> have / has + P(II)

### B. When we say that 'something has happened', this is usually new information

- Ow! I **'ve cut** my finger.
- The road is closed. There **'s been** an accident.

When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with *now*. The action in the past has a result *now*:

- Where's your key? I don't know. I **'ve lost** it (= I don't have it *now*)
- He told me his name, but I **'ve forgotten** it (= I can't remember it *now*)

### C. Note that the different between gone (to) and been (to)

- James is on holiday. He **has gone to** Italy (= he is there now or on his way there)
- Jane is back home now. She **has been to** Italy (= she has now come back)

### D. You can use present perfect with just, already and yet

**Just** = a short time age:
- Hello. **Have** you **just arrived**?

We use **already** to say that something happened sooner than expected
- Don't forget to pay your electricity. I **'ve already paid** it

**Yet** = until now. Yet shows that the speaker is expecting something to happen. Use **yet** only in questions and negative sentences:
- I've written the mail, but I **haven't sent** it **yet**

## Present Perfect 2

### A. Example

When we talk about a period of time that continues from the past until now, we use *present perfect* (**have been**, **have travelled**)

- **Have** you ever **eaten** caviar?
- We **'ve** never **had** a car
- '**Have** you **read** Hamlet?' 'No, I **haven't read** any of Shakespeare's plays.

**Been (to)** = visited
- I **'ve** never **been to** China. Have you **been** there?

### B. In the following examples too, thew speakers are talking about a period that continues until now

(**recently** / **in the last few days** / **so far** / **since breakfast**)

- **Have** you **heard** anything from Brian **recently**?
- I **'ve met** a lot of people **in the last few days**.
- Everything is going well. We **haven't had** any problems **so far**
- It's good to see you again. We **haven't seen** each other **for a long time**

### C. In the same way we use the present perfect with today / this evening / this year etc when these periods are not finished at the time of speaking

- I **'ve drunk** four cups of coffee today.
- **Have** you **had** a holiday **this year**?

### D. We say: It's the (first) time something has happened. For example

- Don is having a driving lesson. It's his first one. It's the first time he **has driven** a car (or He **has never driven** a car **before**)
- Saras has lost her passport again. This is the second time this **has happened**

## Present perfect continous (I have been doing)

### A. It has been raining

> Have/ has been + V-ing

We use present perfect continous for an activity that has **recently stopped** or **just stopped**. There is a connection with *now*

- You're out of breath. **Have** you **been running**? (= you are out of breath *now*)
- Paul is very tired. He **'s been working** very hard. (= he's tired *now*)
- Why are your clothes so dirty? What **have** you **been doing**?

### B. It has been raining for two hours

Study this example situation:

It began raining two hours ago and it is still raining.
How long **has** it **been raining**?
It **has been raining** for two hours.

We use the present perfect continous in this way especially with **how long**, **for**, **since**, ... The activity is still happening or has just stopped.

- **How long have** you **been learning** English? (= you are still learning English)
- Where have you been? I **'ve been looking** for you **for the last half hour**
- Chris **hasn't been feeling** well **recently**

You can use the present perfect continous for actions repeated over a period of time
- Silvia is a very good tennis player. SHe **'s been playing since she was eight**.

### C. Compare I am doing and I have been doing

- Dont't disturb me now. I **'m working** (*now*)
- I **'ve been working** hard. Now I'm going to have a break.
