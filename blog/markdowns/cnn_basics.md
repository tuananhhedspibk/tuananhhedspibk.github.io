Depending on the features that you saw, you categorize things in certain ways

CNN can classify images

input images -> CNN -> labeled images

**B / W images** can be treated in 2d array with every single one of those pixels having a value between 0, 255

**Colored Image**, we have 3d arrays and 3 layers **blue**, **red**, **green**, each one of those colors has it onwed intensity

There are four steps to construct one CNN
- Step 1: Convolution
- Step 2: Max Pooling
- Step 3: Flattening
- Step 4: Full Connection
