## Present continous

### A. Example

Sarah **is driving** to work.

This means: she is dring **now**, at the time of speaking. **This action is not finished**

> Am/Is/Are + V-ing is the present continous

### B. I am doing something = I'm in the middle of doing it, I've started doing it and I haven't finished

- Please don't make so much noise. **I'm trying** to work.
- What **'s going** on?

Sometimes the action is not happening at the time of speaking.
More examples:

- Kate wants to work in Italy, so she **'s learning** Italian
- Some friends of mine **are building** their own house. They hope to finish it next summer

### C. We can use present continous with today/ this week/ this year (periods arround now)

- You **'re working** hard **today**.
- The company I work for **isn't doing** so well **this year**.

### D. We use present continous when we talk about changes happening around now, especially with these verbs

> get, change, become, increase, rise, fall, grow, improve, begin, start

- **Is** your English **getting** better?
- The population of the world **is increasing** very fast.

## Present Simple

### A. Example

Alex is a bus driver. He **drives** bus, but he is in bed asleep now.

> I/we/you/they drive/work/do

> He/she/it drives/works/does

### B. We use present simple to talk about things in general. We use it to say that something happens all the time or repeatedly, or that something is true in general.

- Nures **look** after patients in hospitals.
- I usually **go** away at weekends.
- The earth **goes** round the sun.

### C. We use do/does to make questions and negative sentences

- I come from Canada. Where **do** you **come** from?
- I **don't go** away very often.
- What **does** this word **mean**?

**do** is also the main verb
- What **do** you **do**? I work in a shop
- He's always so lazy. He *doesn't do** anything to help.

### D. We use the present simple to say how often we do things:

- I **get** up at 8 o'clock **every morning**
- **How often** do you **go** to the dentist?

### E. I promise/ I apologise

Sometimes we do things by saying something. For example:

- **I promise** I won't be late

In the same way we say **I apologise**, **I advise**, **I agree**, **I refuse**

## Present continous and present simple 1

### A. Compare

We use present continous for **temporary situations**
- I **'m living** with some friends until I find a place of my own
- You **'re working** hard today. Yes, I have a lot to do

We use the simple for **permanent situations**
- My parents **live** in London. They have lived here all their lives
- Joe isn't lazy. He **works** hard most of the time.

### B. I always do and I'm alway doing

I **always do (sth)** = I do it every time
- I **alway go** to work by car.

I **'m always doing** something has negative meaning
- I've lost my phone again. I **'m always losing** things. (I lose things very ofter, perhaps too often, or more than normal)
- You **'re always playing** video games. You should do something more active.

## Present continous and present simple 2

### A. We use continous form for actions and happenings that have started but not finished

Some verbs (for example, **like**, **know**) are not normally use in this way.
We don't say "I am knowing" or "They are liking"; we say "I **know**"m "they **like**".

The following verbs are not normally used in the present continous

- **like**, **want**, **need**, **prefer**
- **know**, **realise**, **suppose**, **mean**, **understand**, **believe**, **remember**
- **belong**, **fit**, **contain**, **consist**, **seem**

For examples:
- I'm hungry. I **want** something to eat.
- **Do** you **understand** what I **mean**?

### B. Think

WHne **think** means "beleive" or "have an opinion", we do not use present continous
- I **think** Mary is Canadian, but I'm not sure

When **think** means "consider", the continous is possible
- I **'m thinking** about what happened.

### C. See, hear, smell, taste

We normally use present simple with these verb
- **Do** you **see** that man over there?
- This room **smells**

We often use **can + see/hear/smell/taste**
- I **can hear** a strange noise. **Can** you **hear** it?

### D. Look, feel

You can use the present simple or continous to say how somebody looks or feels now

- You **look** well today *or* You **'re looking** well today
- How **do** you **feel** now ? *or* How **are** you **feeling** now?

### He is selfish and He is being selfish

He **'s being** = He 's behaving / He 's acting
- I can't understand why he **'s being** so selfish. He isn't usually like that.
- He never thinks about other people. He **is** very selfish (*not* He is being)

We use **am/is/are being** to say how somebody is **behaving**. It is not usually possible in other sentences
- It **'s** hot today (*not* It is being hot)
- Sarah **is** very tired (*not* is being tired)

## Past simple

### A. Very often the past simple ends in -ed (regular verb)
- I work in a travel agency now. Before that I **worked** in a department store.
- We **invited** them to our party, but the **decided** not to come

But many verbs in *irregular*. For example **wrote**, **saw**, **went**, **shut**
- Mozart **wrote** more than 600 pieces of music.
- We **saw** Tanya in town a few days ago.

### B. To be - is/are -> was/were
